# Hi, I'm Yusuf Adeboye,
 
   I am a goal-oriented individual who loves getting things done and making decisions backed up with data with minimal or no assumptions.
 I'm more passionate about using data to drive success and help firms make important decisions backed by Data.
  I've learned extensively and honed my skills as a Data Analyst, implementing data cleansing, developing dashboards, providing data insights and recommendations, and collaborating with diverse teams.
